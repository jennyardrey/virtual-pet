Virtual Pet

This project will create a virtual pet that will do the following:

Will have a name

Will get older

As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit 😅

You can walk the pet to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️

You can feed the pet to decrease it's hunger. 🍕

You can talk to the pet to see if it needs feeding or walking 🗣️

If the pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀

If the pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢

The pet can have little babies! 👶
